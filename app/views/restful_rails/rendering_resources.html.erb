<div id="textoCapitulo">
	You can render your resource in any one of the following ways:

	<h3>render_resource</h3>
	Will render the resource:
	<pre>
def show
  @order = Order.find(params[:id])
  render_resource @order 
end</pre>

	If you want to pass an extra hash as options to the serializing function (to_xml, to_json, ...), you can do:
<pre>
def show
  @order = Order.find(params[:id])
  render_resource @order, { :exclude=> "paid_at"} 
end</pre>

	<h3>render</h3>
	You can render the resource with the typical render method:

	<pre>
def show
   @order = Order.find(params[:id])
   render :resource => @order, :with => { :exclude=> "paid_at"}, :status => 201, :other_extra_key => :value
end
	</pre>

	<h3>format</h3>
	render_resource detects what the format is and is able to render xml, json, pretty much in the same way that respond_to works:

	<pre>
def show
   @order = Order.find(params[:id])
   respond_to do |format|
      format.html # show.html.erb
      format.xml  { render_resource @order, :except => [:paid_at] }
      format.json { render_resource @order, :except => [:paid_at] }
   end
end
	</pre>
	
<h3>Content type negotiation</h3>

The chosen media type to render will be selected between the formats available for your resource and your client's <b>Accepts</b> header. By default, <b>application/xml</b>, <b>application/json</b>, <b>text/html</b> and <b>application/xhtml</b> are available by default.

<h3>Other media types</h3>

In order to support other media types, you can invoke your <b>media_types</b> method within your <b>ActiveRecord</b>:

<pre>
	class Hotel < ActiveRecord::Base
		acts_as_restfulie
		media_type "vnd/caelum_hotel+xml", "vnd/caelum_hotel+json" # registering custom media types
	end
</pre>

Note that the default media types are always registered for all your <b>ActiveRecord</b> that <b>acts_as_restfulie</b>.

<h3>Rendering collections</h3>

If you render a resource collection, it will use the default media types available.

<h3>Collection as atom feed</h3>

In order to render a collection as an atom feed, you can invoke its <b>to_atom</b> method:

<pre>
def index
  @hotels = Hotel.all
  content = @hotels.to_atom(:title=>'Hotels', :controller => self)
  render :content_type => 'application/atom+xml', :text => content
end
</pre>

If you want to partially generate each entry xml while rendering the atom feed, pass a block to the <b>to_atom</b> method:
<pre>
	def index
    @hotels = Hotel.all
    content = @hotels.to_atom(:title=>'Hotels', :controller => self) do |item|
      item.to_xml :controller => self, :only => [:name], :skip_instruct => true
    end
    render :content_type => 'application/atom+xml', :text => content
  end
</pre>


	<h3>etag support</h3>

	When a client accesses a resource's representation for the first time, <b>Restfulie</b> automatically generates the etag from your resource as <b>etag = resource</b> and returns it to the client.<br/><br/>

	The client will then be able to send it back to the server when further working with this representation. Once the client sends the etag again, the server invocation to render_resource will use its value to check if the client cached representation is still valid. If it is, the server will return a 304 Not modified response and not render the response again.<br/><br/>

	Proxy servers staying between the client and the server might use the information provided by the server to lower even further the latency by not hitting the server if possible.<br/><br/>

	Server-side controller:
<pre>def show
  render_resource Order.find(params[:id])
end</pre>

	Server-side model:
	<pre>class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
	transition :latest, {:action => :show}
end</pre>

	Client side usage:
	<pre>
order =  Order.from_web uri # executes a GET request, receives the etag and last-modified
puts order.price

order = order.latest # executes a GET, receives a 304
puts order.price</pre>

	<h3>last modified</h3>

	If your resource answers to the method *updated_at* (as ActiveRecord already does), its result will be used to set your resource's representation response header "Last modified". Pretty much as with the *etag*, the server will respond with a 304 Not modified if the resource last update matches the new client's request.
	
<h3>rendering a resource after its creation</h3>

When a resource is created, a response code 201 should be returned with an optional representation of the created resource.

In order to do that, Restfulie allows you to invoke the <b>render_created</b> method:

<pre>
	if @order.save
		render_created @order
	end
</pre>

Render created will also set the Location response header to the resource retrieval location.
