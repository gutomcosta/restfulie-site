<h3>A generic controller</h3>

Common resources will include CRUD, search and security features through the use of the appropriate HTTP verbs and characteritics.
In order to make it easier to deal with those cases, <b>Restfulie</b> has a custom generic controller that you can either inherit from or include its content into your own controller:

<pre>
class CitiesController < ApplicationController
  include Restfulie::Server::Controller
end
</pre>

<h3><a name="404">Automatic 404 support</a></h3>

For all single model related requests, a <b>404</b> response will be returned if the resource is not found.

<h3><a name="show">Inherited method: show</a></h3>

The default <b>show</b> method will search for the resource and, if not found, return <b>404</b>.

If the resource is found, content negotiation takes place in order to render it according to the client preferences.

<h3><a name="delete">Inherited method: delete</a></h3>

The default <b>delete</b> method will search for the resource and, if not found, return <b>404</b>.

If the resource is found, it will be deleted.

<h3><a name="create">Inherited method: create</a></h3>

The default <b>create</b> method will instantiate a model based on the request body string.

<blockquote>Automatic creation does not support model creation based on request parameters if there is no body.</blockquote>

The instantiated resource will be saved and, if successful, return a <b>201</b> with the resource location as the <b>Location</b> header.
