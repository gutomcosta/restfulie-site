        	<p>For what it's worth, this is the best approach to REST I've seen, and I am loving trying this out. I had been thinking of something similar (but not quite so elegant) previously, so it's nice to see it "in the flesh," as it were. :) Great job!</p>

        <p>	I hope Restfulie's creators will be offered a seat on the JSR for JAX-RS 2.0 so that it can earn the “R” in its acronym. And if a mature Ruby version of Restfulie makes it into Rails at some point, that would be nice too.

        	<p>I think that Restfulie beautifully captures the hypermedia concepts and helps developers build hypermedia applications.
			I can’t wait for our book to become available so that more people can read about our take towards REST and hypermedia when building distributed applications. As everything else that we’ve done, I am expecting some controversy, which is good (TM) :-).</p>

        	<p>@jimwebber @restfulie at any event, I think that a restfulie like standardized media type manipulation is worth adding to RESTEasy.</p>
